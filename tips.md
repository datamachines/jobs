* Take notes during the interview. This is good practice for any professional meeting and shows that you care and will follow up on what was discussed. 
* We care more about your ability to learn and teach others more than about raw technical ability or knowledge. It's guaranteed that you will always be learning new technologies and methods, success is predicated on your ability to collaborate. Also, if we hire you we'll have to work with you. Be a person that's good to work with.
* Communicate clearly and tactfully. Avoid college slang or vulgarity.
