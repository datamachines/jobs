# Tips and advice for progressing in your career
Random notes for those who want to move into or succeed in leadership roles at Data Machines. 

## Finish projects
It's easy to start new projects, it's hard to finish them. Although you may have personally developed through learning while working on projects that you don't finish, they aren't something you can point to as a success until they are finished. When somebody asks "show me what you got", try make sure you have something to point to for each project you've started or contributed to. This can be anything from openly available code, a publication, or even a summary write-up or presentation to show. The best kind of finished project is code running in production and touched by real users.  

## Never say no or "it's not my job"
Be eager and ready to contribute, always. If somebody is coming to you, it's because they need help. If you think what they need is a bad idea or that they have underestimated the level of effort, suspend your disbelief for long enough to do some objective thinking, research, and evaluation. If you still think it's a bad idea or too difficult, still say yes but try to honestly and accurately present what you feel is the actual level of effort or downsides. Then if they still want to move forward, help anyway. You'll gain a friend and still learn along the way. 

## Go to meetings
If you weren't invited to a meeting or private slack channel but wanted to be, ask to attend anyway. Try to have a useful opinion and be accurate and thoughtful in what you say. Being a leader means getting involved in the conversations that lead to project or company decisions. You, as an employee, are welcome to join in and contribute. We will happily pile access and responsibility on anybody that wants it and demonstrates consistently good results.     

## Never let your personal feelings detract from you work
Some work is stressful. Try to relax and do the objectively best thing. We get it, you care. A lot. But you do your best work when you're objective and methodical. Try to maintain that through all things. Especially when interacting with other humans.  
## Avoid burn-out
Burnout is a real risk. It usually is caused by being too emotionally tied to the work. Somewhat ironically, the main symptom of burnout from caring too much is not caring at all. If you find yourself not caring about your work, you've burned yourself out. Take a step back, take a day off, watch a good movie, spend time with your family, go outside and do something fun. Let your inspiration and motivation come back naturally, it usually will within a day or two.  

## Be Aware of Imposter Syndrome
Be aware of and mentally manage your own identity and self-worth to the group or project. Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon or fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a concept describing individuals who are marked by an inability to internalize their accomplishments and a persistent fear of being exposed as a "fraud". Gifted people often work hard in order to prevent people from discovering that they are "impostors". This hard work often leads to more praise and success, which perpetuates the impostor feelings and fears of being "found out". The "impostor" person may feel they need to work two or three times as hard, so over-prepare, tinker and obsess over details, says Young. This can lead to burn-out and sleep deprivation.

## Have Humility
Humility is a critical leadership trait for creating an environment where employees feel included. Learn from criticism and admit mistakes. Patiently allow others to demonstrate their knowledge without interjecting with "one-upper" statements. Be genuinely happy and supportive of the success and learning of others. Realize that it's not all about you and learn to relax. You can't be a leader unless people want to be around you.

## Be genuine and honest
Keep your promises. Do the right thing because it's the right thing. Bad news doesn't get better with time, have difficult conversations early and often. 

## Never present a problem without a solution
Leaders are problem solvers. If you've identified a problem and need to brief it to your leadership, also include some thoughtful proposed solutions. Do the work and do the research to be able to speak intelligently about the problem. Sometimes through this reserach and work the problem may get solved easily. Even a few minutes or an hour of research can be invaluable, it doesn't take much effort. 

## Be cognitively courteous to others
Being cognitively courteous means communicating in a way that gets your point across without requiring the receiving person to have to think or work very hard to understand you or make a decision. Write short emails. Take the time to re-read your emails before sending and see how short you can make them. Nearly all correspondence should be less than 5 sentences. Also, when making recommendations or requesting a meeting, suggest dates and times. Don't ask "to meet next week" as this requires the receiver to think through prioritizing their next week and make guesses about your calendar. Instead ask to "meet next Tuesday at 10am in the blue conference room"; this makes the receiver only have to make a binary decision instead of trying to evaluate a range of possibilities. 

## Look people in the eyes when they talk and listen
Don't be afraid to look people in the eyes. Pay attention and listen. Your ability to listen to what people are saying is absolutely the most important thing you can do as a leader. 

## Always have something to write with and something to write on
Never be caught without a pen and paper. If you're in a meeting, always take notes. Note the date and time of the meeting (in ISO 8601 format), who attended, what is discussed, and what the action items are. Draw check-boxes for your own action items. Put stars next to the really important action items. Review your notes and follow up. 

## Continually seek self improvement
You've never have and never will "make it". Continually look for and take action on ways to improve your professional capability, thoughtfullness, compassion, kindness, generosity, and the other traits that make you a good person that people want to work with.

## Bloom where you are planted
You need to ensure you are relevant to your environment. The work you have on your plate is what you have. Put the effort in to do well with the challenges and tools at your immediate disposal. If you do poorly with what you have, it's far less likely you'll be trusted with more difficult challenges or more powerful tools. 

## Be generous with your time
If somebody wants to talk to you, stop what you're doing and give them your time freely. Have meaningful and unrushed conversations. This includes your family. It's ok to stop working when interrupted by your family and spend time with them. Conversely, do set aside uninterrupted time to focus. Understanding that since we think for a living, interruptions can be time-consuming to recover from and destructive. Balancing your time and ability to focus and also being generous with your time will be a continual struggle. There's no right answer. You need to make this balance happen in a way that is supportive to you, your colleagues and family, and your work.

## Write lots of emails and make lots of phone calls
Good leaders are deliberate and prolific in their communications. This is second in importance only to listening when others communicate back. Don't sit and wonder about something and don't ever "wait" on somebody else. If you've ever said the statement "I'm waiting on x to do y", you're wrong. Never wait. Email or call and know that x will do y next Monday morning. Then email or call again to see how y went and if x needs any help. This is how things get done. 

## Write good emails
Always start emails with a positive sentence to set the tone. If replying, write a simple "Thank you for <something short, positive, and specific>!" Be careful of the words you use, i.e. never start a sentence with a negative statement such as "no, that's wrong". Be succinct and cognitively courteous with what you want to say. End the email with another positive sentence. 

## Praise in public
Never give negative feedback in public, in email, text, or any written correspondence. Doing so publicly is hurtful and embarrassing and that pain will become all that the recepient hears. Have necessary difficult conversations in person and in private and keep them tactful and succinct and only if absolutely necessary. If possible, use metaphor and analogy as opposed to direct criticism to allow the recepient to objectively understand the problem rather than focusing on their own humiliation. Ask them for their opinions and thoughts and LISTEN. 

## Guard your reputation and stay beyond reproach
Perception is reality. If somebody perceives you as having bad traits, that colors the reality of the interactions you will have with them. Staying beyond reproach doesn't mean being perfect, it means making good decisions both in and out of work. You can't always be perfect, but you can always be ethical and honest in what you do. Be a caring and thoughtful human being. Don't associate with others who don't value legal and ethical conduct. Be aware of how your actions and associations might color other's perception of you. Spend the time to communicate to manage your reputaiton and guard it from misrepresentation or misunderstanding. We also sometimes work in competitive environments, so don't give your colleagues uneccessary potential ammunition to use against you intentionally or accidentally. Even ethical and honest people can mistake or misrepresent facts to better fit an incorrect or unflattering narrative. As a leader you need to be aware of this and take it into consideration during your interactions. Your personal reputation is the most valuable thing you own, guard it carefully. 

## Understand every single person is different
As a leader you deal with people. People are not computers. Every single one has a life as complex (or more) than your own. Everybody will have good days and bad days. Respect that. There are very few general approaches to communicating or problem solving that work with everyone. Spend the time to make sure the approach you're using for each person is tailored to their own complex reality, biases, and mood.
